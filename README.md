# FACEBOOK CLONE

## Project Description
The challenge is to create a minimal working facebook clone with the the underlying database and controller structures, but not the realtime notifications (i.e. backend focused).  It's a learning exercise set by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project?ref=lnav).
